# Test suite

An index of every test module and what it protects. Each module's own
docstring explains the reasoning in full; this page is for finding the right
file. `tests/test_documentation_indexes.py` fails when a module is added,
renamed or removed without updating this page.

## Running

```bash
uv run pytest                                   # full suite
uv run pytest tests/test_waivers.py             # one file
uv run pytest tests/test_waivers.py::test_name  # one test
uv run pytest -k "waiver and not rating"        # by expression
uv run nox                                      # Python 3.10-3.14
```

`pytest` is only available under `uv run`. The web application tests need the
`web` extra and the `test` dependency group, and skip themselves when FastAPI
is not installed. They use the in-process `memory://` Redis, so no Redis server
is needed.

## Conventions

- Test names are sentences that describe the behaviour they protect, and each
  test has a one-line docstring saying why it matters.
- Assert the negative case as well as the positive one.
- Scan `fake_opencloud.py` rather than mocking `requests`, and take
  expectations from a real scan of it. Hardcoded lists go stale.
- TLS, CAA and DNSSEC tests run against real servers on loopback, not mocks of
  `ssl` or `socket`.

## Shared support

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`conftest.py`](conftest.py) | Autouse fixtures: strip every `COS_` environment variable, keep machine-wide configuration files out, and stub retry sleeps. Also passes coverage settings to subprocesses. |
| [`fake_opencloud.py`](fake_opencloud.py) | A real HTTP server that plays an OpenCloud instance, driven by an `InstanceBehaviour` dataclass. |
| [`browser_support.py`](browser_support.py) | Browser test plumbing: the web app, an in-process worker and fake targets served from a thread; WebKit or Firefox behind a dead proxy so nothing leaves loopback; a watch for console errors, CSP violations and stray requests (ADR 0061). |
| [`webapp_support.py`](webapp_support.py) | Web test plumbing: an isolated in-process Redis per test, an offline resolver, and skipping when the web extra is missing. |
| [`integration/test_real_opencloud.py`](integration/test_real_opencloud.py) | Opt-in (`-m integration`): scans a real OpenCloud container. Needs a container runtime. |

## Scanner (`opencloud_local_scan/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_local_scanner.py`](test_local_scanner.py) | The whole scan pipeline against the fake instance: status, capabilities, headers, exposed paths, protected endpoints, extra checks. |
| [`test_scanner_robustness.py`](test_scanner_robustness.py) | The scanner against a target that answers badly: malformed, empty, binary or failing status answers, an oversized body, capabilities of the wrong shape, a server that never answers, a redirect loop and addresses that cannot be parsed all end in a `ScanError`, never another exception or a hang. |
| [`test_concurrency.py`](test_concurrency.py) | Concurrency only affects speed. Any worker count gives the same result, and one worker stays single-threaded. |
| [`test_ssrf_pinning.py`](test_ssrf_pinning.py) | Connections stay pinned to the address that passed validation. |
| [`test_address_parity.py`](test_address_parity.py) | Every address a name resolves to is scanned, so a pool node that missed a rollout is not hidden behind a healthy one. |
| [`test_tls.py`](test_tls.py) | What the TLS layer shows, and what the scanner refuses to claim. Uses a real TLS server with a generated certificate. |
| [`test_dns.py`](test_dns.py) | The DNS wire format shared by the CAA and DNSSEC lookups (synthetic bytes, no network). |
| [`test_caa.py`](test_caa.py) | CAA record parsing, and the lookup against a real UDP server on loopback. |
| [`test_dnssec.py`](test_dnssec.py) | The DNSSEC check. It must not report a resolver that strips EDNS0 as an unsigned zone. |
| [`test_cross_origin.py`](test_cross_origin.py) | CORS and the other checks of what an instance grants a foreign origin. |
| [`test_forwarded_host.py`](test_forwarded_host.py) | Whether an instance builds its public URLs from a `Host` or `X-Forwarded-Host` the caller picked. |
| [`test_companions.py`](test_companions.py) | The collaboration (office) backend published on the same origin. |
| [`test_advisory_headers.py`](test_advisory_headers.py) | Headers that are reported but never counted against a deployment. |
| [`test_advisory_checks.py`](test_advisory_checks.py) | Non-header observations (e.g. `security.txt`) that are reported but never counted. |
| [`test_hardening.py`](test_hardening.py) | Every check the scanner can report appears in the hardening catalogue. |
| [`test_waivers.py`](test_waivers.py) | Waiving hardening findings, and declaring an instance's release track. |
| [`test_waiver_expiry.py`](test_waiver_expiry.py) | A waiver with a reason and a deadline, and the alert coming back when it passes. |
| [`test_change_explanation.py`](test_change_explanation.py) | Why two results differ, claimed only as far as the evidence supports. |
| [`test_webapp_html_report.py`](test_webapp_html_report.py) | The standalone report: no request on opening, and nothing in it is markup. |
| [`test_remediation.py`](test_remediation.py) | The remediation planner never promises a grade that its fixes would not reach. |
| [`test_snippets.py`](test_snippets.py) | Configuration fragments for fixes, and that they match the prose describing them. |
| [`test_explain.py`](test_explain.py) | Debug mode: why a rating is what it is, and what each hardening identifier means. |
| [`test_cli_explain.py`](test_cli_explain.py) | Looking up a finding identifier from the catalogue without running a scan. |
| [`test_diff_command.py`](test_diff_command.py) | `check-opencloud-scanner diff`: the changes between two saved scans, and refusing to compare different instances. |
| [`test_service.py`](test_service.py) | The HTTP scan service that runs in the container, including its result cache. |
| [`test_config.py`](test_config.py) | Layered configuration (file, environment, flags) and the secret providers. |
| [`test_settings_completeness.py`](test_settings_completeness.py) | A setting is present in the dataclass, `factory.py`, the example config and its flag, with none missing. |

## Releases, versions and advisories

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_release_schedule.py`](test_release_schedule.py) | Version parsing, comparison and the release schedule. |
| [`test_releases.py`](test_releases.py) | The update check: GitHub feed, pinned version, bundled data, `off`, and awareness of release tracks. |
| [`test_vulndb.py`](test_vulndb.py) | The advisory database and its three input formats. |
| [`test_refresh_data.py`](test_refresh_data.py) | The command that refreshes reference data on a monitoring host. |
| [`test_data_signing.py`](test_data_signing.py) | Sigstore attestation of refreshed reference data, and still working without `sigstore` installed. |
| [`test_reference_data_limits.py`](test_reference_data_limits.py) | Size limits on the daily reference-data fetches, so an oversized response cannot crash the worker. |
| [`test_version.py`](test_version.py) | `pyproject.toml` is the only source of the version. |

## Plugin (`check_opencloud_security.py`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_rating_thresholds.py`](test_rating_thresholds.py) | How ratings and thresholds map to Nagios exit codes. |
| [`test_check_vulnerabilities.py`](test_check_vulnerabilities.py) | The whole check in-process: the alert line, detail lines, perfdata, the baseline and the result payload all receive and print what the scan found. |
| [`test_perfdata.py`](test_perfdata.py) | Plugin output: perfdata, hardening reporting, formatting. |
| [`test_output_formats.py`](test_output_formats.py) | `--format json/sarif/junit` for one host and for several. |
| [`test_prometheus.py`](test_prometheus.py) | Prometheus rendering and the native `/metrics` exporter. |
| [`test_otlp.py`](test_otlp.py) | `--format otlp`: the same metrics as the exposition, as a collector's body. |
| [`test_webhook.py`](test_webhook.py) | The optional webhook notification. |
| [`test_baseline.py`](test_baseline.py) | `--baseline` and `--warn-on-new`: report only what changed. |
| [`test_multi_host.py`](test_multi_host.py) | Host parsing, target validation, retries and runs across several hosts. |
| [`test_env_config.py`](test_env_config.py) | `COS_` environment variables and the config file as argparse defaults. |
| [`test_e2e_cli.py`](test_e2e_cli.py) | End to end: both CLIs run as subprocesses over real HTTP against the fake instance. |
| [`test_completion.py`](test_completion.py) | Shell completion, and a host without `argcomplete` running exactly as before. |
| [`test_selfupdate.py`](test_selfupdate.py) | `--upgrade-self` uses the right tool (pip, pipx, uv) for the installation. |
| [`test_wizard.py`](test_wizard.py) | The interactive setup behind `--configure`. |

## Web application (`webapp/` + `frontend/`)

### API, security boundary and limits

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_webapp_api.py`](test_webapp_api.py) | The public API: accepted and refused fields, SSRF refusals, no leaking of other scans, no third parties. |
| [`test_webapp_workflows.py`](test_webapp_workflows.py) | The workflow layer: async scans, polling, 404 vs 409, not resubmitting refused targets. |
| [`test_webapp_worker.py`](test_webapp_worker.py) | The worker turns a queued uuid into a scan and a rendered dashboard. |
| [`test_webapp_batch.py`](test_webapp_batch.py) | Batch submissions, with each target still checked against every limit. |
| [`test_webapp_rescan.py`](test_webapp_rescan.py) | Rescans go through the normal submission path, and reading the cooldown does not use it up. |
| [`test_webapp_probe_guard.py`](test_webapp_probe_guard.py) | A client whose scans keep finding no OpenCloud, the same host included, is blocked for an hour; one finding OpenCloud never is. |
| [`test_webapp_abuse_guards.py`](test_webapp_abuse_guards.py) | Networks instead of addresses, escalating blocks, refused targets as strikes, the daily cap, misleading DNS names and approval mode. |
| [`test_webapp_security_headers.py`](test_webapp_security_headers.py) | The security headers on every kind of response - errors, JSON, exports, the badge, static files, redirects, the operator's area; nothing tied to a uuid is cacheable; the docs' relaxed policy covers exactly `/docs` and `/redoc`. |
| [`test_webapp_blocked_targets.py`](test_webapp_blocked_targets.py) | Operator-excluded addresses stay blocked at submission, in the worker and on redirect. |
| [`test_webapp_client_identity.py`](test_webapp_client_identity.py) | Behind a proxy, the address a request is counted as cannot be chosen by the client. |
| [`test_webapp_request_provenance.py`](test_webapp_request_provenance.py) | Where a request really comes from (`X-Forwarded-For`), and whether it was meant (cross-site checks). |
| [`test_webapp_security_audit.py`](test_webapp_security_audit.py) | Repository audit regressions: anonymous transport, response/request limits, erasure races, origin checks, JWKS fetch bounds and scan-process cleanup. |
| [`test_webapp_encryption.py`](test_webapp_encryption.py) | Results are encrypted at rest, with no way to fall back to plaintext silently. |
| [`test_webapp_purge.py`](test_webapp_purge.py) | Erasure on request: the data is gone, nothing else is touched, and the receipt remains. |
| [`test_webapp_audit.py`](test_webapp_audit.py) | The audit trail records events and pseudonymises addresses and targets. |
| [`test_redis_contract.py`](test_redis_contract.py) | The real Redis client and `MemoryRedis` behave the same. |

### Operator area

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_webapp_admin.py`](test_webapp_admin.py) | The `/admin` area and the refusals that keep it closed to everyone but the operator. |
| [`test_webapp_admin_configuration.py`](test_webapp_admin_configuration.py) | The admin Configuration tab: every `COS_WEB_*` variable listed and documented, and no credential ever rendered. |
| [`test_webapp_admin_rules.py`](test_webapp_admin_rules.py) | The admin Rules tab: every rule shown with the numbers the deployment runs with, marked off when it is off, and nothing anybody scanned. |
| [`test_webapp_admin_exclusions.py`](test_webapp_admin_exclusions.py) | The one admin control that writes: exclusions apply at once, with no restart. |

### Contracts and agents

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_webapp_openapi.py`](test_webapp_openapi.py) | The OpenAPI document matches what the real endpoints do. |
| [`test_webapp_arazzo.py`](test_webapp_arazzo.py) | The Arazzo workflow description stays consistent with the OpenAPI schema. |
| [`test_contract_documents.py`](test_contract_documents.py) | External validation of the published API contract. |
| [`test_webapp_discovery.py`](test_webapp_discovery.py) | An agent that only has the address can find the contract, with nothing switched on by the operator. |
| [`test_webapp_mcp.py`](test_webapp_mcp.py) | MCP tools call the ordinary API, and destructive tools require the operator's credential. |
| [`test_webapp_mcp_auth.py`](test_webapp_mcp_auth.py) | The optional sign-in in front of `/mcp` refuses as firmly as it accepts. |
| [`test_webapp_webmcp.py`](test_webapp_webmcp.py) | Browser WebMCP registration and the public LLM discovery file. |

### Reports and pages

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_webapp_pages.py`](test_webapp_pages.py) | The informational pages can be reached, describe themselves, and link back. |
| [`test_webapp_exports.py`](test_webapp_exports.py) | Exporting a scan as a file, and refusing malformed export requests. |
| [`test_webapp_badge.py`](test_webapp_badge.py) | The grade badge: what it draws, what it never carries, and when it 404s. |
| [`test_webapp_feeds.py`](test_webapp_feeds.py) | The advisory and release-schedule Atom feeds. |
| [`test_webapp_compare.py`](test_webapp_compare.py) | The comparison page between two scans agrees with `compare_scans`. |
| [`test_webapp_compare_upload.py`](test_webapp_compare_upload.py) | An uploaded report is rebuilt from an allow-list, never kept, and the comparison drawn from it expires within five minutes. |
| [`test_webapp_result_continuity.py`](test_webapp_result_continuity.py) | The tab title follows the scan, later scans offer a comparison, and the page warns before a report expires. |
| [`test_webapp_fragment.py`](test_webapp_fragment.py) | The configuration fragment on a report page, in every flavour and within the CSP. |
| [`test_webapp_tls_overview.py`](test_webapp_tls_overview.py) | TLS facts shown next to the grade, without the web layer judging them. |
| [`test_webapp_catalogue_links.py`](test_webapp_catalogue_links.py) | Every finding links to a catalogue anchor that exists, and every catalogue entry can be linked to. |
| [`test_webapp_frontend_controls.py`](test_webapp_frontend_controls.py) | Report and form controls work without scripting, which only enhances them. |
| [`test_webapp_print.py`](test_webapp_print.py) | The printed or PDF report, including dark mode not printing a blank page. |
| [`test_webapp_share.py`](test_webapp_share.py) | Sharing a report never contacts a third party or leaks the capability link. |
| [`test_webapp_seo.py`](test_webapp_seo.py) | Docs pages are indexable, results never are, there is no third-party card metadata, and the mobile nav fits. |
| [`test_webapp_i18n.py`](test_webapp_i18n.py) | The frontend is translated without changing API contracts. |
| [`test_translation_quality.py`](test_translation_quality.py) | Structural differences between the catalogues fail; prose heuristics warn. |
| [`test_coverage.py`](test_coverage.py) | Every check has one state, an unmeasured one says why, and none of it moves the grade. |
| [`test_webapp_coverage.py`](test_webapp_coverage.py) | Scan gaps regrouped and translated, and an older report that records none. |
| [`test_webapp_search.py`](test_webapp_search.py) | The browser search built at release, and what result data it may contain. |
| [`test_frontend_documentation.py`](test_frontend_documentation.py) | Browser documentation generated from the Markdown guides. |

### In a real browser

These need Playwright's browser build once: `uv run playwright install webkit`
(and `firefox` and `chromium`, the other engines in CI). Without it they skip
locally; `.github/workflows/browser-tests.yml` runs every
`test_webapp_browser_*.py` in all three with `PLAYWRIGHT_TESTS_REQUIRED=1`.
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSER=firefox` or `chromium` picks another engine; Chromium is
Google's build, allowed behind the dead proxy (ADR 0068).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_webapp_browser_ux.py`](test_webapp_browser_ux.py) | Every public page runs clean under its CSP, fits a phone, and hides what is marked hidden; navigation, theme, language, validation, waiver search, site search and back-to-top behave; below-the-fold blocks reveal on scroll and after a jump, and hide nothing without JavaScript; an unknown address gets the 404 page. |
| [`test_webapp_browser_e2e.py`](test_webapp_browser_e2e.py) | A visitor's journeys: form to report for three instances, the waiting page's hand-over, severity filters, every export, waivers, no JavaScript, keyboard only, a German report, an unknown uuid. |
| [`test_webapp_browser_enhancements.py`](test_webapp_browser_enhancements.py) | The script enhancements no other browser test drives: remembered form settings, the configuration-fragment picker, share buttons, the rescan countdown and the expiry warning. |
| [`test_webapp_browser_mobile.py`](test_webapp_browser_mobile.py) | On a 390-pixel touch screen: a tapped menu link navigates, a scan runs by touch, an open menu closes when the screen turns wide, menu targets are big enough to tap, no field makes iOS zoom, and without JavaScript every menu link stays on screen. |
| [`test_webapp_browser_operator.py`](test_webapp_browser_operator.py) | The pages a deployment turns on: every admin page runs clean under its CSP, the poll fills every tile, a stranger gets the ordinary 404, the actions stay plain forms without JavaScript, and Swagger UI and ReDoc render from the vendored bundles. |

### Self-refreshing data

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_webapp_schedule.py`](test_webapp_schedule.py) | The daily lifecycle refresh only adds knowledge, and a failed fetch changes nothing. |
| [`test_webapp_advisories.py`](test_webapp_advisories.py) | The daily advisory refresh under the same rules. |

## Packaging, distribution and deployment

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_webapp_packaging.py`](test_webapp_packaging.py) | The wheel and sdist contain the plugin and scanner, but no web application. |
| [`test_distro_packaging.py`](test_distro_packaging.py) | What the `.deb` and `.rpm` install, and where. |
| [`test_homebrew_formula.py`](test_homebrew_formula.py) | The Homebrew formula matches its generator and the runtime imports. |
| [`test_github_action.py`](test_github_action.py) | The published GitHub Action uses only flags and variables the plugin accepts. |
| [`test_contrib_assets.py`](test_contrib_assets.py) | The Grafana dashboard, Prometheus rules and Checkmk check match the exporter. |
| [`test_helm_chart.py`](test_helm_chart.py) | The Helm chart renders, and its flags are the plugin's own. |
| [`test_docker_wizard.py`](test_docker_wizard.py) | `docker/setup-wizard.py` writes a valid compose file, keeps credentials in `.env` only, and never overwrites an existing deployment. |
| [`test_docker_wizard_hardening.py`](test_docker_wizard_hardening.py) | The setup wizard on unexpected ground: a symbolic link where the compose file or `.env` belongs, an edited answers file, an unreadable `.env`, input that ends or is interrupted, answers the prompt turns away, and credentials never shown at their prompt. |
| [`test_wizard_release.py`](test_wizard_release.py) | The Docker wizard attached to a release reports its version and ships with a checksum. |

## Repository, CI and release process

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`test_check_pull_request.py`](test_check_pull_request.py) | `scripts/check_pull_request.py`: a changelog entry is present, and version bumps only move forward. |
| [`test_claude_hooks.py`](test_claude_hooks.py) | The Claude Code hooks in `.claude/hooks/` keep refusing merges, force-pushes, hand edits to generated files, and real hosts, scan output or personal data in commits, and refuse when they cannot run. |
| [`test_mutation_testing.py`](test_mutation_testing.py) | The manual mutation-testing setup stays consistent: mutmut only in its own group and with a record, its test files in-process, `mutants/` ignored, and `/mutation-test` running in the read-only agent. |
| [`test_dependency_policy.py`](test_dependency_policy.py) | `scripts/check_dependencies.py`: every Python dependency has an approved, tested and reviewed record, or predates the policy, and the grandfather list never grows. |
| [`test_release_notes.py`](test_release_notes.py) | `scripts/release_notes.py` turns `## [Unreleased]` into the release section. |
| [`test_release_dry_run.py`](test_release_dry_run.py) | The release rehearsal matches the release, and publishing to PyPI happens last. |
| [`test_security_advisories.py`](test_security_advisories.py) | Every `### Security` changelog entry has a decided record in `security/advisories/`. |
| [`test_update_script.py`](test_update_script.py) | `scripts/update_release_schedule.py` and the generated README schedule. |
| [`test_workflow_hardening.py`](test_workflow_hardening.py) | GitHub workflows use least-privilege tokens and pinned action references. |
| [`test_documentation_indexes.py`](test_documentation_indexes.py) | The hand-maintained indexes (README contents, `docs/README.md`, the documentation manifest, this page) match what they index. |
| [`test_documentation_links.py`](test_documentation_links.py) | Which documented OpenCloud links the post-merge check verifies. |
| [`test_render_architecture_diagrams.py`](test_render_architecture_diagrams.py) | Each Mermaid diagram in `ARCHITECTURE.md` has a matching PNG. |
