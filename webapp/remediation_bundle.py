"""
The work to do, on its own, in the syntax the files that have to change use.

The other exports answer "how is this instance doing": they carry the grade,
what passed, the advisories, the transport measurement, the provenance. That
is the right shape for a ticket or a quarterly record and the wrong shape for
the afternoon somebody actually sits down to fix it, because the fixes are
spread through a document that is mostly not about them.

A bundle is the complement. It contains **only what is still open and can be
acted on** - each finding, the evidence the scanner recorded for it, and the
nginx, Caddy, Traefik, Compose and ``.env`` fragments that satisfy it - and
nothing else. No grade, no passed checks, no advisory list: those are in the
report next to it, and repeating them here would bury the one thing this file
is for.

Three properties are deliberate.

**It selects, it does not judge.** Which findings are open is
:func:`webapp.catalog.open_findings`, the same list the dashboard's fragment
picker uses - failed checks, missing hardenings, missing headers, with waived
and unfixable entries already dropped. This module decides nothing about
severity, order or acceptability; it only leaves out what was never open.

**Every fragment is rendered, not one.** The dashboard picks a flavour because
a reader is looking at one screen. A file handed to somebody else has no
picker, and the person who opens it may well be the one running Caddy when
the scan was read by the one running Compose, so all five are written out and
each says which findings it covers. What a flavour cannot express is named
under it rather than silently missing, which is the same promise
:class:`opencloud_local_scan.snippets.Fragment` makes.

**Untrusted text stays text.** Part of the evidence is a string the *scanned*
instance chose - a product name, a ``WWW-Authenticate`` challenge, a directory
index. In the HTML bundle that is escaped exactly as the report escapes it; in
the Markdown one it is escaped as well, because a detail containing
``[click](javascript:...)`` would otherwise become a link in whatever renders
the file. The catalogue's own explanations are not escaped: they are this
repository's text, and defending them against ourselves would only fill every
sentence with backslashes.
