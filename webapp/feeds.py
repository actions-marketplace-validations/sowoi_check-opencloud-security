"""
The reference data as Atom feeds: what this service has learned, subscribable.

Two documents refresh themselves daily and may only ever gain knowledge - the
advisory database ([ADR 0017](../adr/0017-the-advisory-database-refreshes-itself.md))
and the release schedule ([ADR 0016](../adr/0016-the-release-schedule-refreshes-itself.md)).
Until now the only way to notice a new advisory was to open `/catalogue` and
remember what had been there before, which is not a thing anybody does. A feed
is the cheapest possible way to be told, and it needs nothing from this
service that a visitor could not already read.

Both feeds are built from the same functions the pages use - `advisories`'
catalogue and the `ReleaseSchedule` object a scan is rated against - so a feed
and the page describing the same advisory cannot drift apart.

Everything from the advisory source is **somebody else's text**. It is escaped
and carried as `type="text"`, never as markup: a feed reader that rendered an
advisory title as HTML would be running a string this project did not write,
in an application nobody inspected. For the same reason the feeds are English
like every other machine-readable document here (ADR 0020).
