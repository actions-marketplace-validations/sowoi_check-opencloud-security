# Keeping the release schedule and advisories current

Two verdicts depend on data rather than on the instance. End of life comes
from a release schedule, and known vulnerabilities come from an advisory
database. Both ship inside the package, so a host that only upgrades the
package every few months rates instances against a picture of OpenCloud that
is months old. That means a new release it has never heard of, and an
advisory published after the package was built.

`check-opencloud-scanner refresh-data` closes that gap without a package
upgrade. This page covers what it fetches and how it checks the data, how to
run it daily, and how to point the check at the result.

## When you need it

- **A scan names a version the schedule does not know.** The lifecycle line
  then says the release is newer than anything in the bundled release
  schedule, and the result document carries `"scheduleStale": true`. See
  [Release tracks, end of life and the update recommendation](release-lifecycle.md).
- **An advisory was published after your package was built.** The bundled
  database cannot match it, so the scan reports no known vulnerabilities for
  a version that has one.
- **You pin the package** and upgrade it on your own schedule rather than
  whenever a release appears.

A host that upgrades the package promptly gets the same data that way, and
needs none of this. The [public scan service](webapp.md) refreshes its own
copy at runtime and needs none of it either.

## Running a refresh

```bash
check-opencloud-scanner refresh-data --output-dir /var/lib/check-opencloud-security
```

On success it prints the two files it wrote and exits `0`:

```text
/var/lib/check-opencloud-security/release_schedule.json
/var/lib/check-opencloud-security/vulnerabilities.json
```

| Option | Default | What it does |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `--output-dir` | `~/.cache/check-opencloud-security` | Directory the two files are written to. Created if missing |
| `--timeout` | `30` | Seconds allowed for each request |
| `--schedule-url` | *(none)* | Read the release schedule from this lifecycle page or mirror instead, **unverified**. See [Mirrors](#mirrors-and-hosts-without-internet-access) |
| `--advisory-url` | *(none)* | Query this OSV endpoint or mirror instead, **unverified** |

Any failure exits `1` with the reason on stderr: a network error, a document
that fails a check, or a signature that does not match. Nothing is written
unless both documents pass, so the previous files stay exactly where they
were. A cron job or timer can therefore run it blindly. A bad day upstream
never replaces good data with worse.

Add `-vv` to see each signature being verified:

```bash
check-opencloud-scanner -vv refresh-data --output-dir /var/lib/check-opencloud-security
```

## Where the data comes from, and how it is checked

By default the refresh does **not** query OSV or the OpenCloud lifecycle
page live. It reads `release_schedule.json` and `vulnerabilities.json` from
the `main` branch of this project's repository. Those are the files a
maintainer already reviewed and merged, in the pull requests the project's
daily data workflows open. Nothing reaches your host that a person has not
looked at. See
[ADR 0027](../adr/0027-refreshed-reference-data-is-attested-not-merely-fetched.md).

### Signature verification

Every change to those two files on `main` is attested with
[Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) by this repository's
`attest-security-data.yml` workflow. The refresh fetches that attestation and
checks that it was signed by that one workflow, on `main`, in this
repository. A signature from any other GitHub Actions run does not count.

Verification needs the `signing` extra, which is optional because it pulls in
about a dozen further packages:

```bash
pipx install 'check-opencloud-security[signing]'
```

To add the extra to an existing pipx installation, re-run that command with
`--force`. [Installing the plugin](installation.md) has the uv and pip
equivalents.

There are three outcomes, and they are deliberately different:

| Outcome | What happens |
|:--|:--|
| The signature verifies | The document is used |
| The signature could not be *checked* | A warning, then the structural checks below only. Causes: the extra is not installed, GitHub or the Sigstore trust root is unreachable, or no attestation is published yet for that content |
| A signature is present and **wrong** | The refresh stops, exits `1`, and writes nothing |

Without the extra, every run logs this for each file and still succeeds:

```text
WARNING check_opencloud.refresh_data: Refreshing the release schedule without verifying its signature: the 'signing' extra (sigstore) is not installed. Install the 'signing' extra (pip install check-opencloud-security[signing]) to verify it.
```

A host that shows this warning is not checking where its data came from.
Install the extra wherever the refresh matters.

### The checks that apply either way

A verified signature proves where a document came from, not that it makes
sense. So these checks run on every refresh, signed or not:

- **The release schedule may not lose a release line.** Every line in the
  schedule bundled with the installed package must still be present. A
  truncated or rewritten lifecycle page cannot quietly make an old release
  look supported.
- **The advisory database must have usable entries.** It must contain at
  least one advisory, and every advisory needs a version bound. An advisory
  open at both ends would match every OpenCloud release there has ever been.
- **Each file is replaced atomically.** A reader never sees half a file.

## Using the refreshed files

The refresh only writes files. It never writes into the installed package, so
nothing changes until the check is told where to look:

```yaml
scanner:
  release_schedule: /var/lib/check-opencloud-security/release_schedule.json
  vulnerability_db:
    - /var/lib/check-opencloud-security/vulnerabilities.json
```

Or through the environment:

```bash
COS_SCANNER_RELEASE_SCHEDULE=/var/lib/check-opencloud-security/release_schedule.json
COS_SCANNER_VULNERABILITY_DB=/var/lib/check-opencloud-security/vulnerabilities.json
```

The two settings behave differently:

- `release_schedule` **replaces** the bundled schedule.
- `vulnerability_db` **adds to** the bundled database. Entries are
  de-duplicated by id, so listing the refreshed file alongside the bundled one
  is safe.

Both the plugin and `check-opencloud-scanner scan` read the same settings.
Confirm it took effect with the scanner's JSON output:

```bash
check-opencloud-scanner -c /etc/check-opencloud-security/config.yml \
    scan opencloud.example.com | jq '.advisorySources, .lifecycle.scheduleUpdated'
```

`scheduleUpdated` should be the date of the refreshed schedule, and
`advisorySources` should list the refreshed file.

**Check both after any change of path or user, because neither failure is
loud:**

- **A schedule file that is missing or unreadable turns the end-of-life check
  off.** The check does not fall back to the bundled schedule. The lifecycle
  line reads `Release lifecycle: unknown (no release schedule available)`,
  `scheduleUpdated` is `null`, and nothing is logged below `-vv`. An
  end-of-life release is then rated on its configuration alone. In testing, a
  2.3.0 instance that is otherwise CRITICAL came out as `OK` and `A+`.
- **An advisory file that is missing or unreadable is skipped with a
  warning** on stderr (`Advisory file ... does not exist`, or `Ignoring
  advisory file ...: Permission denied`). An unreadable file still appears
  in `advisorySources`, so read the warning rather than the list.

## Running it daily with systemd

[`contrib/systemd/`](../contrib/systemd/) has a hardened oneshot service and a
timer for it:
[`check-opencloud-security-refresh.service`](../contrib/systemd/check-opencloud-security-refresh.service)
and
[`check-opencloud-security-refresh.timer`](../contrib/systemd/check-opencloud-security-refresh.timer).
The service writes to `/var/lib/check-opencloud-security` through
`StateDirectory=` and may write nowhere else. The timer runs it daily,
randomised within an hour, and catches up after downtime.

```bash
sudo cp contrib/systemd/check-opencloud-security-refresh.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now check-opencloud-security-refresh.timer
sudo systemctl start check-opencloud-security-refresh.service   # a first run now
journalctl -u check-opencloud-security-refresh.service
```

**Run it as the user the check runs as.** Both files are written readable by
their owner only (mode `0600`). The unit ships with
`User=check-opencloud-security`, so a check running as `nagios` or `icinga`
cannot read what it wrote. That silently turns the end-of-life check off. See
[Using the refreshed files](#using-the-refreshed-files). Either run the check
as that user, or change the refresh user with a drop-in:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit check-opencloud-security-refresh.service
# [Service]
# User=nagios
```

`ExecStart=` expects `/usr/bin/check-opencloud-scanner`, which is where the
`.deb` and `.rpm` packages install it. Adjust the path for a pipx or pip
installation. Without systemd, a daily cron line does the same job. See
[Scheduling](scheduling.md).

## Mirrors and hosts without internet access

A default refresh needs HTTPS access to `raw.githubusercontent.com`, and,
for verification, to GitHub's attestation API and the Sigstore trust root.
There are two ways to serve a host that has none of that.

**Refresh elsewhere and copy the files.** Run the verified refresh on a
connected machine with the `signing` extra, then copy the two files to the
same paths on the isolated host. The files are self-contained, and the copy
keeps the verification you did.

**Point the refresh at a mirror.** `--schedule-url` takes a copy of the
OpenCloud lifecycle page. `--advisory-url` takes an OSV-compatible query
endpoint, whose answer is merged into the bundled database:

```bash
check-opencloud-scanner refresh-data \
    --output-dir /var/lib/check-opencloud-security \
    --schedule-url https://mirror.example.com/opencloud/lifecycle/ \
    --advisory-url https://mirror.example.com/osv/v1/query
```

Nothing signs a mirror, so both options skip signature verification and say
so on every run. The structural checks above still apply. Use this for an
internal mirror you control, not as a way around a signature failure.

## Your own advisories

`scanner.vulnerability_db` takes a list, so a file of your own sits beside the
refreshed one. Three formats are understood without conversion: the native
`{"advisories": [...]}` document, the GitHub Advisory API format, and OSV
documents. The [main README](../README.md#advisory-database) describes the
formats and how entries match a version. `scanner.vulnerability_feed` queries
a feed live on every scan instead of reading a file.

## Points worth knowing

- **A refresh only ever changes data, never code.** No new check, finding or
  rating rule arrives this way. Those still need a package upgrade.
- **An empty `vulnerabilities` list is not a clean bill of health.** It means
  nothing in the databases you configured matched this version. The
  configuration checks carry most of the rating either way.
- **Refresh the files the check actually reads.** The default output
  directory is under the home directory of whoever runs the refresh, so a
  refresh run as root does nothing for a check running as `nagios`.
- **The web application does not use this command.** It refreshes its schedule
  and advisory database at runtime, and may only ever gain knowledge. See
  [the public scan service](webapp.md).
