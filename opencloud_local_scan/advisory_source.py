"""
Read published OpenCloud advisories from OSV.

The advisory database that ships with this package is what decides whether a
scanned instance is reported as vulnerable, and until now nothing kept it
current: it was written by hand and shipped empty, so the first published
OpenCloud advisory reached nobody. This module is the other half of that -
the part that asks.

`OSV <https://osv.dev>`_ is the right source to ask. It aggregates the GitHub
Security Advisories for ``opencloud-eu/opencloud`` and the Go vulnerability
database into one schema that :mod:`opencloud_local_scan.vulndb` already
understands, it needs no token, and it is queried by package rather than by
repository, which is what an operator running a Go binary actually has.

Two things this module refuses to do, both of them because a false alarm from
a security tool is expensive:

* **Take an unbounded record at face value.** A record that does not say which
  versions it affects matches every version there has ever been. The parser
  drops those; the count guard here catches the case where a query somehow
  returns a whole ecosystem.
* **Lose an advisory.** A merge only ever adds. A feed that answers with an
  empty list - because it is down, because a package was renamed, because
  somebody typed the name wrong - leaves the database exactly as it was.
