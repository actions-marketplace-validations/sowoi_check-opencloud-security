"""
A summary of the fleet, from the result documents already on disk.

Somebody running twenty instances has twenty archived reports and four
questions the reports never answer on their own:

* **Which instances run a release nobody patches any more?** Each report says
  so about itself, but only as of the day it was written. A release line that
  was supported last month can have closed since, so the recorded version is
  placed in the release schedule again, as of today.
* **Which waivers are about to run out?** A waiver's deadline is written in
  the report of the one host it applies to. Nobody reads twenty reports to
  find the one that alerts again on Friday.
* **What is wrong everywhere?** A finding that fails on fourteen instances is
  one change to a shared template, not fourteen tickets.
* **What did the fleet not look at?** An instance whose last report is a
  month old, whose last scan failed, or that has no report at all, is not an
  instance in good shape. It is one nobody knows about.

This module answers them from files. **It never scans and it stores
nothing**: the reports are read, summarised and forgotten, and the summary is
printed. Collecting the reports into one directory - a cron job writing
``check-opencloud-scanner scan`` output, a CI artefact store, a shared mount -
is left to whatever the operator already uses.

It measures, it does not judge, for the same reason
:mod:`opencloud_local_scan.remediation` does not: ratings stay the scanner's
0-5 numbers, and nothing here decides that a count is a WARNING. A dashboard
that went red would be a second set of thresholds nobody configured.
