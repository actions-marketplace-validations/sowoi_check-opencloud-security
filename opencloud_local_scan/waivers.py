"""
Accepting a failed check, for a while, for a stated reason.

A waiver is an operator saying "I know, and not today". The existing form of
that is a pattern in ``--ignore-hardening``: it suppresses the alert, it says
nothing about why, and it lasts until somebody remembers to take it out.
Nobody remembers. A year later the check is still failing, the alert is still
suppressed, and the reason is in a ticket nobody can find.

This adds the two things that fix that - a reason and a deadline - without
taking anything away:

* **A pattern on its own is still a permanent waiver.** Every existing
  configuration keeps working and keeps meaning what it meant.
* **A temporary waiver is refused unless it is complete.** It needs a
  non-empty reason and a timezone-qualified expiry. A record that cannot be
  parsed is an error, never a permanent waiver by accident - failing open is
  how a typo becomes a blind spot that outlives everybody who knew about it.
* **Expiry is decided once, at the start of the scan, in UTC.** The boundary
  is ``now >= expires_at``: at the stroke of the expiry the waiver is over.
  Nothing re-reads the clock while the scan runs, so a long scan cannot have
  a check waived at the top and not at the bottom.
* **Every applicable record is reported, not just the one that matched.**
  Otherwise a permanent ``*`` sitting quietly in a configuration file would
  mask the expiry of every temporary waiver underneath it, and the report
  would say the suppression was still deliberate when it was not.

None of it touches severity, grading or the rating. A waiver decides whether
an alert is raised; the evidence stays exactly as measured.
