"""
Remember what a host looked like last time, so a run can report only what changed.

Monitoring a long-lived instance produces the same alert every five minutes for
as long as an issue takes to fix, which is how people learn to ignore it. A
baseline records the findings of the previous run per host; the next run can
then stay quiet while the picture is unchanged and speak up the moment it gets
worse.

Two things are deliberately *not* forgiven, no matter how long they have been
true:

* **A release that is past its end of life.** It gets no security fixes at all,
  so every day it stays in production is worse than the last one.
* **A rating that drops further** than it was at the time of the baseline.

One thing is reported that is not a finding at all: **a check that was
measured before and is inconclusive now.** The grade can stand still while
the evidence behind it shrinks, and a scan that quietly stopped being able to
see something is not a scan that found it fine. That is a statement about
coverage, kept apart from the findings and from the rating - see
:attr:`Comparison.coverage_lost`.

And a finding is only called new if the previous run could have reported it.
A check the scanner learned after that run - or one a probe setting kept it
from making - that fails now was *not measured* before, not passing, and is
named as such: :attr:`Comparison.newly_measured`. It still alerts, because
nobody has been told about it yet; it is just not blamed on the instance.

The file is written atomically, because a monitoring plugin is killed by its
own timeout often enough that a half-written baseline is a question of when,
not if.
