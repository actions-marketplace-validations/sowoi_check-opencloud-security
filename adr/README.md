## Writing a new record

Create an ADR for a decision that changes a layer boundary, public interface,
security or deployment model, data lifecycle, or a long-lived dependency. Do
not create one for routine implementation details or temporary tasks.

Use zero-padded, never-reused filenames:

```text
0001-short-decision-title.md
```

Use this template:

```markdown
# ADR 0001: Short decision title

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR NNNN
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

What problem requires a durable decision?

## Decision

What is the chosen approach?

## Consequences

What becomes easier, harder, required or deliberately out of scope?

## Alternatives considered

What credible alternatives were rejected, and why?
```

Accepted ADRs are historical records: do not rewrite their decision. When a
decision changes, add a new ADR and mark the older record as superseded.

Add every new record to the index above in the same change, with its title
and status as they appear in the record itself.
